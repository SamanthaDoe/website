## Fundraisers
We're excited to announce our newest fundraiser event: Computers for Kids!
WRHS Computer Club is partnering with Clarkson Middle School to get them the computers they can't afford.
How are we doing this you ask? *Bitcoin mining!*

Okay but what's Bitcoin mining? Well <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-to-mine-bitcoin-everything-you-need-to-know">here's an article that explains it all</a>!
Essentially, the students at WRHS are using their CPUs to help benefit the community. Instead of idling, they will be working away to gather BTC!
All BTC gathered will be promptly donated to Clarkson Middle School ITS.

We're excited to have you on board with us! Please email [Samantha Doe](mailto:samantha.doe@westridge.k12.ny.edu) for more information, or come to our meetings after school!
